I forked lichess for the good goofy chess pieces.

After 8:15 PM PST, 2/8/2024 my little own break was over and it was time to push this project to .exe and then to itch.io

I made this project to teach myself to learn how to not get blocked by antivirusus even though when your project is harmless, thanks a lot JSON!
